#Snake Game Using C++

My first project in C++ is a simple console based snake game. It is a fun gan where snake moves and it has to eat the fruits.

#Some key points

1. The snake can move left, right,up aand down by pressing keys 'a','d','w' and 's' respectively.
2. The fruit F is visible within the box and when the snake eats that fruit, the length of snake's body increases and the score gets updated.
3. The snake can come out through other side of the wall if it hits one side of the wall.
4. The game gets over when the snake touches its own body while moving.
